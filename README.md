# Human Resource Machine

Martin's solutions for [Human Resource Machine](http://tomorrowcorporation.com/humanresourcemachine).

## Usage

To try my solutions, open the solution file for a given level, copy its contents to the clipboard, and then paste the program into one of the tabs in Human Resource Machine. Make sure to try and solve the puzzles yourself before being spoiled by my solutions!

## Level Overview

The “Challenge” column lists the targets for the size (the number of instructions) followed by the speed (the number of steps during execution) challenges. The “Variant A/B/C” columns list the values achieved by the given solution. (A metric that even manages to stay below the target value is highlighted in **bold**.)

| # | Level Name | Challenge | Variant A | Variant B | Variant C |
